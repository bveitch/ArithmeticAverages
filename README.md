# ArithmeticAverages

Simple code to calculate averages of the form,
&Sigma;{1<n<x} f(n),   

where, f(n) is an arithmetic function of the form,  
f(n) = &Sigma;{d divides n} a(d).  

Examples of this are:\
Dirichlet divisor problem  : f(n) = &Sigma;{d divides n} 1\
Sums of powers of divisors : f(n) = &Sigma;{d divides n} d^a\
Chebyshev function         : f(n) = log(p) if n=p^a (p prime)\
Gauss circle problem       : f(n) = number of representations of n as sum of two squares
