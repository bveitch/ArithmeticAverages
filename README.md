# ArithmeticAverages
Averages of arithmetic functions
Simple code to calculate averages of the form,
sum_{1<n<x} f(n), 
where f(n) is an arithmetic function of the form,
sum_{d divides n} a(d). 

Examples of this are:
Dirichlet divisor problem  : f(n) = sum_{d divides n} 1
Sums of powers of divisors : f(n) = sum_{d divides n} d^a
Chebyshev function         : f(n) = log(p) if n=p^a (p prime) 
Gauss circle problem       : f(n) = number of representations of n as sum of two squares
